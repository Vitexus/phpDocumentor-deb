Description: enables you to generate documentation from your PHP source code. 
 a tool that makes it possible to generate documentation directly 
 from your PHP source code. With this you can provide your consumers with more 
 information regarding the functionality embedded within your source and not 
 just what is usable to them from your user interface.
 .
 Documentation generated by phpDocumentor 2 does not aim to be a replacement for 
 conventional documentation but is rather supplemental, or reference, documentation.
 This proves to be useful in the following example situations:
 .
 * Sets of libraries or applications providing an API, such as phpDocumentor 2 itself
 * Frameworks, such as Zend Framework or Symfony
 * Pluggable architectures, such as WordPress or PyroCMS
 * Long-running, complex projects, to help you find the right function or method for the job
